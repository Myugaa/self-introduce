About me

Hello, this is Myugaa.


My favorites

1. Playing piano
2. Games (don't mind any, except for jumpscares)
3. Cooking (pastas rule.) 
4. Shopping gadgets
5. Would coding count? (OC, lol)



I'm currently doing:

* FastCampus's Megabyte School program for Front-end beginners


I'm planning to:
1. Read more books and watch more videos on JS
2. Read "Things You Can't Buy" in English and Korean
3. Register at a nearby gym


That's all for today!
Thank you for reading.
